        <h2>kelpful? pnwkelp? eatkelp?</h2>
        <p>This website was purchased at the 2021 WWU Sailing Alumni Regatta afterparty when Amber said "yo, lets grow some kelp and save the planet."</p>
        <p>Kelp could be the next easy to grow, renewable food source that requires very little land footprint and has exeptionally high yeild.</p>
        <h2>so, there's a lot of kelp...</h2>
        <h2>why kelp?</h2>
        <p>I'm just the tech guy (as you can tell by my horrible art skills).  But I think Amber said that kelp is a really good carbon sink and restore local populations of fish and other sealife.</p>
        <p>Tor said we should be planting the kelp rn.  He also said we could use the same DNR permits for oyster farming.  We really don't have much money or organization.  But that might be fixed with a few Rainers.  Chandler had some good advice too, I just cannot remember what it was.  GC offered some geology b.s. (shrug).</p>
        <h2>we're crazy!</h2>
