The following is an assortment of photographs from late July to late August 2021.  I was busy with work, and all the photo sets were of a single subject.
Sunday, July 18th, 2021
My roommates and I took the day sailing on a CBC J24 sailboat.  This set has many photos, but I didn't take a few of them.  These first ones were all Nate's doing, so I have minimal comments.  If he ever makes a blog, I will link it.

I took these final photos of Nate as we were towed back to the mooring because the wind had died.

The camera settings were all over the place based on who was holding the camera.  The only notable shot was Nate with the boat hook, where I opened the lens up to f1.4.

I forgot about this set, maybe because I was trying to forget.

Another short set, only two good photos here.  My mom relaxing in her new apartment.

I took my camera out rowing to Chuckanut Island and arrived just past dawn.

Spot the crab!
