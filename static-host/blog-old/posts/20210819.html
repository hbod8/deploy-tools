      <h5>Thursday, August 19th, 2021</h5>
      <p>The following is an assortment of photographs from late July to late August 2021.  I was busy with work, and all the photo sets were of a single subject.</p>
      <h5>Sunday, July 18th, 2021</h5>
      <p>My roommates and I took the day sailing on a CBC J24 sailboat.  This set has many photos, but I didn't take a few of them.  These first ones were all Nate's doing, so I have minimal comments.  If he ever makes a blog, I will link it.</p>

      <p>I took these final photos of Nate as we were towed back to the mooring because the wind had died.</p>

      <p>The camera settings were all over the place based on who was holding the camera.  The only notable shot was Nate with the boat hook, where I opened the lens up to f1.4.</p>
      <h5>Thursday, July 22nd, 2021</h5>
      <p>I forgot about this set, maybe because I was trying to forget.</p>
