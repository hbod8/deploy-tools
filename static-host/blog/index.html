        <p>This is a photography blog by Harry Saliba.  I am by no means a professional, subject matter expert, or even notably good at photography.  So, that being said, I'm basically goofing off and practicing my website design.</p>

    <!-- <p>Speaking of website design, this whole website was written by hand, no <abbr title="Cascading StyleSheets">CSS</abbr> libraries were imported, not even a Google Font <abbr title="Content Delivery Network">CDN</abbr> reference.  Although I did steal the <abbr title="True Type Font">TTF</abbr> from Google.  If you look closely you'll notice that every font size is either a third smaller or larger than another, and all posts are sized in thirds.  And I was way too cheap to buy the Futura font face and join the modernist, minimalist, Bauhaus, hipster bandwagon.</p> -->
