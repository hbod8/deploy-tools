The last day I worked at the CBC was a real send-off, and I led a massive group of participants down the Bellingham waterfront in a parade as they were all dressed as witches.  This class was a treat.  I spent the time in the chase boat with Emily as Sara and Anna took out the smaller electric boat with Tilly.

After about 3 hours of work, Emily and I snuck off and got coffee on the water from Woods.  It was relaxing.

Although the future seemed uncertain for me, I didn't have a job lined up after this one and didn't really have a plan for what I would do.
