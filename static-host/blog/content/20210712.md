Daytime!  After the relative failure of capturing bioluminescence the previous Saturday, I just brought the camera on one of my favorite hikes.  This allowed me to be more playful with the camera.  The photos I captured sort of came as they happened.  When I took photos of bugs on the water, I adjusted the shutter speed to capture them in time.  When a train passed me by the water, I closed the aperture to allow for a greater depth of field.  When focusing on the foreground of seaweed, I opened the aperture to blur the island in the background.

During this entire shoot, I was reminded of something Nate told me: "The zoom on a prime lens is your feet."  This refers to my lens's constant 50mm of focal length (or zoom).  This means I had to position myself to capture the frame I wanted.  This added to the fun of exploring the stream and woods around me, even though I was already familiar with this place.

These next two shots are of a strange painting I found in the woods.

Then, after my hike, I continued down the coast on my motorcycle.

The biggest lesson learned was that: aperture priority of f1.8 can have mixed results.  The shot of the starfish had too narrow a depth of field.
