The biggest news of my life had just come from an offer letter from DocuSign.  After processing this over Christmas, it was time to start my work.  I was now a Full Stack Developer for the Service Protection Team, and we write the systems that security analysts use to prevent fraud at DocuSign.  This information weighed heavy on me as I began to move to Seattle full-time to take advantage of this considerable opportunity.  During this time, my relationship with Sophia had ended, and I struggled with the large transition I was about to go through in my life.

To combat this, I spent time with two people who always made me smile: my mom and my friend Jenny.  Jenny came down from Oak Harbor on Whidbey Island to visit me, and we enjoyed just walking around the city.  It made me feel better about the transition and that I wasn't leaving everything behind in Bellingham.  Also, Jenny is a model, so my photos of her turned out great.
