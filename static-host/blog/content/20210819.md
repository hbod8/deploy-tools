From time to time I capture bits and pieces of moments with my camera, they don't really need a whole post, so they become an assortment.

##### Sunday, July 18th, 2021

My roommates and I took the day sailing on a CBC J24 sailboat.  This set has many photos, but I didn't take a few of them.  These first ones were all Nate's doing, so I have minimal comments.  If he ever makes a blog, I will link it.

I took these final photos of Nate as we were towed back to the mooring because the wind had died.

The camera settings were all over the place based on who was holding the camera.  The only notable shot was Nate with the boat hook, where I opened the lens up to f1.4.

I forgot about this set, maybe because I was trying to forget. (I wasn't very happy with how it turned out).

Another short set, only two good photos here.  My mom relaxing in her new apartment.

I took my camera out rowing to Chuckanut Island and arrived just past dawn.
