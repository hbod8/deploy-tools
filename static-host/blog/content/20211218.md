As winter set in the Pacific Northwest, it became more and more challenging to drag my friend, Nate, out of the house.  I spent all day convincing him to come down to Locust Beach with me to see the sunset, and I was glad I dragged him down.  The sunset was gorgeous.

I also was thrilled with the early Christmas present of my Blundstone Boots.
