Our most infamous program at the end of the season was Middle School Sailing.  An ungodly 20 students and instructors were exhausted from a summer of teaching.  But in the end, watching the students grow was genuinely unique and was one of the most rewarding programs we did.

This evening I accompanied them in a paddle to Marine Park.  Although I usually just did small child-herding and fire-making, this was a treat.

Yumi was the core of the program, and her working with the kids was incredible.
