Here's another little assortment:

##### Sunday, September 19th, 2021

After the massive success of camping on Lummi Island with my co-workers, my dad came to visit me, and we went again on our own.  This time I was sure to capture more photos of the campground.

##### Tuesday, September 28th, 2021

While stuck in my house, bored, I tried to recreate the photo I had taken of myself when I first bought my camera.  I didn't use a high aperture this time and captured my hair.  I also had just read an article on white balance, and from this point on, I usually have my white balance set to the temperature of the sun and then adjust it later in my editor.

##### Wednesday, September 29th, 2021

On a typical Wednesday Race Night, I went out with Anna and took photos of the competitors.  But we couldn't resist taking some photos of ourselves.  These photos of myself I still use to this day (9/19/2022) as my profile photo.  Although it bugs me that I wasn't wearing my competition sailing lifejacket, I borrowed one from the boating center because mine was wet.

I got a cute photo of Amber working at the desk on the way back in.

##### Friday, October 1st, 2021

Thursday night we were racing on Outlaw!  I brought my camera to celebrate our last season's race and caught the final downwind leg into the marina.  This set was a master class in not cleaning my lens.

##### Saturday, October 2nd, 2021

This is a portrait of Sophia on our second or third date.  We headed down Chuckanut and climbed across the rocks down to the water.  There are other photos in this set.  She liked the ones with the water in the background, but the sunset glare was horrible, so I chose this one instead.

##### Thursday, October 7th, 2021

As the season ended, I got one last set in the boatyard.  It's funny, I hadn't expected these to be the last photos of me in the yard, but you never really expect things to happen for the last time when you're doing them.

##### Friday, October 8th, 2021

My first astrophotography pictures on my camera inspired me to take more.   Although many of the photos I took were with Sophia, I tend not to take many anymore.
